**pgmoneta MCP** is the official pgmoneta MCP server built for [pgmoneta](https://pgmoneta.github.io/), a backup / restore solution for [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org).

For now, this server allows you to query the backup info using natural language with your MCP client.

## Overview

**pgmoneta MCP** is built upon [rmcp](https://docs.rs/rmcp/latest/rmcp/). It uses [SCRAM-SHA-256](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7677) to authenticate with pgmoneta server. We also provide an admin tool `pgmoneta-mcp-admin` to help you manage users. For administration commands, see [ADMIN.md](doc/ADMIN.md).

## Build the project

To build the project, run `cargo build` inside project's root directory. Alternatively, run `cargo install .` to build
and install the project.

Two binaries `pgmoneta-mcp-server` and `pgmoneta-mcp-admin` will be built.

Check the `doc` directory for more details.

## Local LLM Support

**pgmoneta MCP** supports local installation of open-source LLM models that can run
without network access. This allows AI-powered backup management using models like
[Llama](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.1), [Qwen](https://ollama.com/library/qwen2.5),
and [Kimi](https://ollama.com/library/kimi-k2) through [Ollama](https://ollama.com).

See [doc/LOCAL_LLM.md](doc/LOCAL_LLM.md) for installation and configuration instructions.
