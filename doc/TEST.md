# Test

## Dependencies

To install all the required dependencies (rust, make and cargo), simply run `<PATH_TO_PGMONETA_MCP>/test/check.sh setup`. You need to install docker or podman
separately. The script currently only works on Linux system (we recommend Fedora 39+). 

## Running Tests

To run the tests, simply run `<PATH_TO_PGMONETA_MCP>/test/check.sh`. The script will build a composed image containing PostgreSQL 18 and pgmoneta, start a docker/podman container using the image (so make sure you at least have one of them installed and have the corresponding container engine started), run a 20-combination compression/encryption `info_test` matrix, and then run the regular test suite. 
The containerized pgmoneta-postgres composed server will have a `backup_user` user with the replication attribute, a normal user `myuser` and a database `mydb`.

The script then runs pgmoneta_mcp tests in your local environment. The tests are run locally so that you may leverage stdout to debug.

## Build only (no tests) 
Run `<PATH_TO_PGMONETA>/test/check.sh build` to prepare the test environment (image, master key generation) without running tests. This always does a full build.

## Fast Iteration of testing
Run `<PATH_TO_PGMONETA_MCP>/test/check.sh test` to run the 20-combination `info_test` matrix and then the full test suite without rebuilding the composed image.

## Unit tests
To run unit tests only, simply run `<PATH_TO_PGMONETA_MCP>/test/check.sh unit` (or `<PATH_TO_PGMONETA_MCP>/test/check.sh unit-only`). This mode performs clean + build setup first, then runs unit tests.

## Integration tests
To run integration tests only, simply run `<PATH_TO_PGMONETA_MCP>/test/check.sh integration`

## CI matrix-only mode
To run CI integration coverage only, run `<PATH_TO_PGMONETA_MCP>/test/check.sh ci`. This mode runs only the 20-combination `info_test` matrix and skips the regular full test suite.

## Single test or module
Run `<PATH_TO_PGMONETA>/test/check.sh test -m <test_name>`. The script assumes the environment is up, so you need to run the full suite first. For quick iteration, run `<PATH_TO_PGMONETA>/test/check.sh build` once, then `<PATH_TO_PGMONETA>/test/check.sh test -m <module_name>` or `<PATH_TO_PGMONETA>/test/check.sh test` repeatedly.

It is recommended that you **ALWAYS** run tests before raising PR.

## Add Testcases

To add an additional testcase, check [Test Organization in Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-03-test-organization.html)

## Cleanup

`<PATH_TO_PGMONETA>/test/check.sh clean` will remove the built image. If you are using docker, chances are it eats your 
disk space secretly, in that case consider cleaning up using `docker system prune --volume`. Use with caution though as it
nukes all the docker volumes.

## Port

By default, the container exposes port 5432 for pgmoneta-mcp to connect to.
